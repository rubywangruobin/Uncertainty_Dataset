"In general, public commitment to representative democracy is highest in countries that have a well-functioning democracy. The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index is one measure of how democratic a country is. The EIU index ranks countries from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates an authoritarian regime and 10 represents a full democracy. The ranking is based on 60 indicators of a country’s performance across five categories: the electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, functioning of government, political participation and political culture. The index is closely correlated with our classification of committed democrats. For example, the Netherlands is ranked higher on the EIU index with a score of 8.8, and 47% of the Dutch can be described as committed supporters of representative democracy. Meanwhile, Nigeria has a democracy index score of 4.5 and just 11% of Nigerians meet the committed democrat criteria.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubywangruobin/uncertainty/main/scatter1.png,"166,179,236,288,306,324,341,370,412,455,474,480,498,500,506,509,516,523,527,528,529,555,572,609,612,616,623,623,628,629,629,660,666,692,710,730,743,766","600,591,368,564,448,502,421,502,511,493,554,582,545,528,501,483,385,475,528,448,554,269,564,493,590,341,350,385,332,305,430,358,340,233,242,305,269,198","3.24,3.38,3.96,4.5,4.67,4.86,5.04,5.33,5.76,6.21,6.40,6.47,6.65,6.67,6.72,6.75,6.83,6.90,6.94,6.96,6.97,7.23,7.41,7.78,7.81,7.85,7.92,7.92,7.98,7.98,7.99,8.30,8.36,8.63,8.80,9.01,9.15,9.39","7,8,33,11,24,18,28,18,17,19,12,9,13,15,18,20,31,21,15,24,12,44,11,19,8,36,35,31,37,40,27,34,36,48,47,40,44,52",38,850,5
