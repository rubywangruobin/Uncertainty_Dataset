"The results suggest that the extent of consensus has risen significantly. Economists were in strong agreement on about a third of the propositions in the latest wave, compared with around 15% in 2011 and less than 10% in 1990. Respondents were more united on their diagnosis of economic problems. And, strikingly, more of them were convinced of the need for muscular policy.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubywangruobin/uncertainty/main/line1.png,"18,75,136,193","185,162,162,71","1990,2000,2011,2020","9%,14%,14%,32%",4,250,4
"Since September, Biden’s job approval has declined 3 percentage points among the public overall, but 7 points among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (from 75% to 68%); over the past six months his job rating among Democrats has fallen 20 points (from 88%). The falloff in this period has been less pronounced among Republicans and Republican leaners (10 points since July), who already overwhelmingly disapproved of the president’s performance. In addition, favorable views of Congress have declined, with the change largely driven by Democrats. Overall, 28% of the public expresses a favorable opinion of Congress, compared with 36% last April. While Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans to have a favorable view of Congress (36% vs. 18%), the share of Democrats who view the Democratic-led Congress favorably has fallen 14 points since last April (from 50%); Republicans’ views are little changed (21% then, 18% now). Nonetheless, the public continues to have a more positive image of the Democratic Party than the Republican Party, though majorities have unfavorable impressions of both. Currently, 43% view the Democratic Party favorably and 35% have a favorable view of the GOP. Ratings for both parties have slipped slightly since last year; notably, both coalitions continue to view their own parties somewhat less favorably than they did in March 2021.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubywangruobin/uncertainty/main/line2.png,"88,142,220,309,407,88,142,220,309,407,88,142,220,309,407","153,162,162,125,178,182,190,181,178,209,212,219,200,234,247","Aug'19,Jan'20,Aug'20,Apr'21,Jan'22,Aug'19,Jan'20,Aug'20,Apr'21,Jan'22,Aug'19,Jan'20,Aug'20,Apr'21,Jan'22","42,40,40,50,36,35,33,35,36,28,27,25,30,21,18",15,450,6
